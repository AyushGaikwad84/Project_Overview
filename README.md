**Payment System:**
The MetroConnect project allows users to book tickets using simple payment methods like UPI and QR code scanning. However, please note that the current payment system does not utilize secure payment processing mechanisms. It relies on manual UPI ID entry and QR code scanning, which are convenient for users but do not provide the same level of security as payment gateways.

**Limitations:**
Manual UPI ID entry
Basic QR code scanning for payment confirmation
For more secure payment options, future versions of MetroConnect will consider integrating reliable payment gateways that offer encryption, secure transaction processing, and fraud protection.
